        <h2>English Translation of "Husn"</h2>
        <p>
            Look, look, what kind of things are here <br>
            They are with me while not being with me <br>
            Is it that easy? <br>
            Look, look, as if my intentions <br>
            Were the same as yours <br>
            Yeah, how naive I am <br>
            <br>
            Ask for my heart someday instead of my beauty <br>
            Oh, I'll melt away in a moment, yeah <br>
            Now don't do that, my heart won't be able to mend itself again <br>
            Your words make me fall apart, yeah <br>
            <br>
            I admit that the world is crazy for you <br>
            Maybe that's why you didn't realise <br>
            That I'm enough for you <br>
            Look, look, tired of this world <br>
            Why do you come here pretending to be innocent? <br>
            What even am I to you? (Yeah) <br>
            <br>
            Then why do you come here wanting to make me cry? <br>
            If you have come, then please stay <br>
            And please ask anything about my day <br>
            Only your presence is enough for me, yeah <br>
            <br>
            Yeah, if one day anyone <br>
            Ever reads your story <br>
            I don't think that my name <br>
            Would be mentioned anywhere in it <br>
            <br>
            Yeah, I'm here <br>
            Look into my eyes, into my eyes <br>
            Look at how my heart is <br>
            Even words can't describe it <br>
            Look into my eyes, into my eyes <br>
            What kind of luck I have <br>
            That you're here while not being with me <br>
            Look into my eyes, into my eyes <br>
            Your incomplete loyalty <br>
            Is all I ask for, I won't ask for anything else <br>
            Look into my eyes, into my eyes <br>
            <br>
            
            Look, look, what kind of fate we have <br>
            Still can't have you despite wanting you <br>
            I'm not even part of this race <br>
            Look, look, what kind of things are here <br>
            I even look at the words around here <br>
            I don't even belong here <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            The lyrics of this song often make me cry, how much I can relate to it. Both the video and the song struck such a chord down there. That ballerina describes me so accurately. 
            <br>
            The three stanzas-
            <br>
            I admit that the world is crazy for you <br>
            <b>Maybe that's why you didn't realise <br>
            That I'm enough for you</b><br>
            Look, look, tired of this world <br>   
        <b>Why do you come here pretending to be innocent?</b><br>
            What even am I to you? (Yeah) <br>
            <br>

            Then why do you come here wanting to make me cry?<br>
        <b>If you have come, then please stay</b><br>
            And please ask anything about my day <br>
            Only your presence is enough for me, yeah <br>
            <br>
            Yeah, if one day anyone <br>
            Ever reads your story <br>
        <b>I don't think that my name <br>
            Would be mentioned anywhere in it </b>
            <br>
            God forbid, Anuv Jain made a song that describes me so well. I had been warned to not take you seriously right from the beginning, still I chose to fall madly in love with you, believing in you. You came with your innocent face but you too knew innocence was missing. <br>After 1st April's discovery I realised what you meant by "I thought you were offended because I sent just two pics with no text" on Feb 14. My innocent heart couldn't comprehend but you yourself knew what you meant. <br>
            <br>
            I took no precedence for you, I innocently thought it's just being busy but when the shock of the flight came I realised that indeed I don't take any precedence, too shy to land a call with me but brave enough to land a trip with a complete stranger axaxaxa. More like laughter of tears and disbelief. <br>
            <br>
            "I admit that the world is crazy for you <br>
            Maybe that's why you didn't realise <br>
            That I'm enough for you" <br>
            Sometimes I felt it like anything, in a world full of men reaching out to women, when one is down in the dumps everything falters. <br>
            <br>
            In India there's a saying,<br>
            "The rule of the world is 28 years old men losing their love of 5 years to some 33 years old dude in a much better position, only for him to 5 years later become that 33 yo dude taking away another 28 years old's love of 5 years."<br>
            When I told this to Abdulov, we laughed a lot on this. What else can be done other than laughing out at such things? <br>
            <br>
            Sometimes I wish I never ever fell for this thing called love. Loving inanimate objects is much easier than loving humans, their hearts may not sway after all. Sometimes when I am reading Kafka's Metamorphosis, the heart aches. It's on pause because it turned out too painful for me. <br>
            His life? Another tragedy in itself. <br>
            <br>
            Why Buddha chose to make the supreme sacrifice to liberate the world becomes more and more evident day by day. <br>
            How many outbursts I had by now? I have lost the count. I who find it hard to speak up, have been trying my best to share my worries, only for all to have fallen on your deaf ears. You chose to address emotions but never the details on your end. <br>
            <br>
            This time I really wanted to turn around a leaf, I addressed my concerns. I saw you and Ksenia became friends, I am happy for that but my anxiety kicked in and thought you will once again ignore me asking for things which involve details. That's why I decided to write a reminder. Then the thought you may get annoyed or take it in a bad way began tormenting me, "Is it really such a sin for me to ask when I never hide anything?" <br>
            <br>
            I became anxious and started typing out everything to Ksenia in hopes she'd convey them to you now that you two know each other. I'm frightened by the idea that if I say things myself, everything will fall on deaf ears. This moment I don't fear things to sound bitter, all I fear is the dreaded silence. Keeping silent might be more comfortable for you than blurting out but I... I will hate you if you do so. <br>
            <br>
            I really want to be patient but all the time I kept waiting made me only to see you not caring has killed my patience. <br>
            I believe in your goodwill and will to build things all over again but I can't help but vomit all the poison from the past that has been there in me The sensation that didn't let me sleep was frightening, it felt as if it wants me to blurt out all there is in me. <br>
            <br>
            Yes, I am selfish, I want to have you all for myself. I want to have you see me for who I am, including things that unsettle you. I want to be a priority. I want to feel special. <br>
            I have no resources, still I try doing my best to make you feel special.
            You... you made me feel special many times, even this time when you printed out my picture and pasted it, I felt very special. <br>
            <br>
            But da, I must say, I want to feel that way more often. I feel special when you reach out for me, bare yourself. Like the day you shared your music tastes. <br>
            <br>
            You keep on saying all but me know barely about the inner you, but hasn't it been long since you bared that to me? <br>
            I don't like reading between words, you often turn hard to understand because it seems you have some misery with words axaxaxa. That's why I say if you want type in Russian but be clearer. <br>
            <br>
            See, in bengali we have a saying, "Pora bhalo lagena, bhalo laagate hoy" It means Nobody naturally likes to study, it is made to be liked. <br>
            Many things don't come naturally, but once it becomes a habit, it becomes natural. Like the way I insert da and axaxaxa everywhere. It started because I tried to use at least a couple of russian words when with you and it sneaked in. <br>
            Is it too much to ask the work place revolutionary to come and start a revolution in my heart as well? To overthrow this sense of being unwanted and reestablish the rule of feeling wanted by my love? <br>
            Even if it takes force, I'd say force yourself to start taking initiatives. Love should happen naturally and it did. But now that I feel this way shattered, unable to do anything anymore. I want you to do it. Take some responsibility. <br>
            I don't enjoy seeing you flirting back. I want you to know that I AM ENOUGH. <br>
            I know it feels enjoyable to be flirted with and yes I'd use the word FLIRTED because as adults we're not innocent enough to not know what is flirting. <br>
            <br>
            I maybe however much unsightly in this state but I'd still rather have you block me out from life than choosing to live for false dreams. And I'd keep on pushing for acceptance from you. <br>
            <br>
            <b>I am done up with all the farce of me being able to accept this breakup idea and so on. This whole time I wasn't there just to feel being tossed away when I had lost it. No, I don't want to feel this way.
            </b> <br>
            A single action speaks louder than a thousand words. <br>
            <br>
            I choose to vomit whatever poison has seeped in my mind over time. The poison has affected already, but it's still not too late to administer the anti dote and that's why I request you to tell everything that has so far been on your mind. I refuse to believe there really is nothing you have to tell, take a couple of days looking at the calenders and going through your chats if necessary. Da, don't make me wait long just because the words maybe unpleasant for me to hear. Time is of the essence, however busy your schedule maybe, make this into a priority. <br>
            And yes, don't cover vaguely, I have already said, choose the language of your comfort but I want a really elaborate answer. However hard it may feel, it is completely possible and I am not going to have a no for an answer. <br>
            <br>
            My self esteem fell so much because I felt all this time that everything has been my fault, I can't express how badly it reflected on me. Every few couple of days taste gone, weight loss, shaky hands and legs, palpitations, on verge of vomiting several times. It has reflected physically on me just not mentally. <br>
            So I request you to go to the core of the issue and clear your heart out. <br>
            <br>
            I know that you can! My heart maybe small but I forgive if my heart feels being honest enough. No, I don't want you to start saying you've been a negative character and such. If it helps you relieve, that is fine to say but I want narrations of events. <br>
            <br>
            There is both devil and divine in us, accepting that devil is the way to help the divine in us. <br>
            If for naught, do it for me please. It'll help me relieve at least. Someday you too might be in my position.
            <br><br>Women post pregnancy have swollen chests, postpartum depression and so on, they become too conscious of themselves and start suspecting every act of the husband. That phase is very hard, most problems in marital families arise from there. <br>
            <br>
            God forbid but what if that day comes for you? I really didn't want to say this but it is important for people to fear karma. The fear of God holds society together and karma keeps acts together. <br>
            I want to quit this life of despair and anxiety and I need your help for that, because not addressing the past keeps bringing trauma for me. Tell by when you want to address these things, I trust you and want to do that more than ever. You give the date by when you would be addressing. <br>
            I am saying things in very raw and unpleasant manner but if I actually didn't care, I wouldn't have bothered even. <br>
            I wanted to word things much better but I hope you would understand where I am coming from, you too have been there afterall. <br>
            Thank you my love for reading this so far. <br>

      <h1>Calmed Down</h1>
      <p>
        For the last two days, I tried a change of environment by staying away from home as much as possible. In that time I also had the opportunity to think about things in a very calm manner. I decided to address the roots of my jealousy and digging deep I reached across some conclusions. Later I tried checking what the internet says and found out they're exactly like I thought. I have attached the screenshots so please do read them.

        Insecurity, I tried thinking why did the physics boy pinch me so much. I mean to be honest his jokes, like about the 8 pin IC and such. I could understand them pretty well and in all honesty... flirt, mb I exaggerated that. But still why did I do/ feel that way?
        I tried thinking, whether I'd have felt that way if it were some drunkard fed up with life bitching about life jokes? Interestingly no.
        So what did I find that made me insecure? Love for what he does. I mean drunkard fed up with life too can be a really funny great guy, but why I won't fear him is he doesn't have in him what I am very insecure about.
        Yes, for quite some time I have been insecure of the fact I can't make myself like whatever I do. In the past too I have said how I am worried everyone seems to be jumping very fast while I stay behind. Interestingly, it is not them jumping but rather the sight of them enjoying what they do which makes me feel down.
      </p>
      <p>
        I thought getting into this legacy university in computer would get me so much exposure. But it has been a really big disappointment, here every other department has great exposure but the IT department is a lifeless one.
        When in the ECE department I get to know how their seniors are so helpful that they arrange extra classes for them to teach arduino kits (robotics kit) and they organise so many innovative tech rounds, I almost sometimes regret my choice of not going into a field I don't like anything much about lol.
        As a kid when I watched discovery, animal planet, etc. I was so fascinated by so many science concepts, especially outer space. Around at class 8th I could go on for hours on end about how the universe formed, how dark matter is expanding the universe and so on. I would have my parents purchase me BBC knowledge magazines, absolutely loved to read about dinosaurs, ancient architecture and what not. When I see people who love what they do, it reminds me of the kid I was, living some of the most fulfilling days of my life.
        Fast forward to now, have lost it and I get jealous if I see it in others lol. Even seeing Debansh posting so much about cybersecurity, things that I too have read but didn't find interesting, with so much enjoyment, I get jealous of him as well lol.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mb this is a reason, I subconsciously acted like that about him than about Andrei lol. My pride seems to refuse to admit that I admire his love for what he does and would want to know from him himself about his life to understand what made him love what he does so much. Mb da, I mb upset over the fact you gave me stickers such that only I could view as if hiding me but I understand if your mom saw exchanging love stickos lol. But yes, about this guy, I kind of understand why I got like this.
      </p>
      <p>
        While on the bus I decided to watch a video about a crash course of computer science terms, there was a line I found funny and important. "Millions of programmers just go around writing code without even feeling the slightest interest in knowing about the things the code is running on, yet they can code too." I felt it personally lol, I can code too, but am I much interested in the things it works on? Nope, in fact I can explain many things in a much better way than an enthusiastic person but I would still be jealous of him because even though I maybe more efficient, he has enthusiasm which I long for so much.
      </p>
      <p>
        Coming to our relationship, da, the fear of abandonment... it originates from my past experience with Johanna, although it was so short, she literally abandoned without even feeling the need for an explanation lol (not lol). I don't have it very much but when things go downhill it comes up sometimes.
"Jealousy happens when we think we are not good enough" that line too, in my eyes you are very much perfect and sometimes I doubt myself so much that I forget all my wonderful qualities. The clarity to see to the depth of things, how many people my age do have this?
I really wish to say sometimes, "I am the best thing that had, has or will ever happen in your life." Then I think, dude you haven't even started earning not to mention your lack of maturity in so many aspects, with what mouth do you expect to say that?
      </p>
      <p>So here I say, "I am the best thing ever." No future tense or attachment like 'even though', after all they say, 'believing is the first step to anything'.</p>

<p>Another of my insecurities is "uncertainty". I am not fond of it at all. This probably comes from the literature I read like Kafka or the history I am fond of reading. In my eyes my role models are Kamikaze suicide bombers or the samurai. In Indian terms it would be the Gujjar Pratiharas who defended the borders of Bharat for over 400 years in face of the world's mightiest empire of back then, the muslim caliphates. In the process they got obliterated though and the muslims ultimately entered Bharat.</p>

<p>"As they charge, we will hold our ground, raise our sword from the ground".</p>

<p>My favorites are people who even in the face of mammoth uncertainty held the ground... yet ultimately perished. So in the face of uncertainty when my spirits are down, I can see myself ultimately perishing for a cause that'd ultimately be run over.</p>

<p>This is why whenever I hear from you on breakup, I feel terrible. I don't want things to end, for I know I can never go back to being just friends with you. Seeing your name on the icon reminds me of all the best time I ever had and I want to have it. I know it sounds cooler this way to say I'll need time to work on myself so I think we should break up for now, resume things later... Blin, as I said such uncertainty haunts me. Need an indefinite break, take. I also like taking breaks to bring in clarity of thought on life and rn too I am kind of on a break. But an uncertainity that mb may not be is haunting.</p>

<p>And the last guy who said jealousy happens when you want the other person to change you. Pffft pathetic to admit but he's correct lol. I understand somewhere that I need to change because I myself don't like many parts about me. I want to drop off this fed up with life narrative of mine so much. So somewhere I sought you to be that reason. I now understand change can never come if I am not the one trying, in your case too it came because you brought it, I just gave the support through my words and presence.</p>

<p>All in all I want to say sorry so much. I have given you so much agonies over these past weeks. I hope you understand it wasn't easy for me. In your happiness lies mine but when the negative emotions, thoughts and experiences overtake me, I myself become the cause of pain for you.</p>

<p>That is why I really want to address these issues with you more often. We can't turn a new leaf without addressing what has already happened.</p>

<p>Now that March is gone, want to resume that weekly time with you! Da, you've now 2-2 day routines so a fixed week day can't happen but let's fix it every week :3 I want that part of the week to be in between us. Because the feeling of knowing that there is a part of the week where its just us is really special and knowing that there indeed is such a day makes my anxiety lessen. This explains why during the time I was on break I felt such calm. If you want to ask for something too please do!</p>

<p>And da, I know I wouldn't immediately be able to vanish my unreasonable reactions. If things like anxiety were really under control then wouldn't have subscribed to it even. That is why I want your help in this, through the small steps for which you may need to go out of your way a little, it will help me a lot. Really. I want to work on my insecurities, I am trying. Simultaneously I don't want things between us to end half hearted just because I am going through a difficult phase.</p>

<p>When I fell in love with you, back then too you received attentions, back then too had friends and what not, still that didn't bother me. Even when we were in the peak of love, people were there, didn't bother me.</p>

<p>Finally with a calm head and my emotions under control I say this.</p>

<p>O my beloved, I ask for your hand, all over again! You are the woman of my dreams for whom I want to be the only person ever going to have the opportunity to dance around a bonfire with. All that I ask if for you and you.</p>

<p>Whosoever, howsoever, whatsoever I maybe at the moment, I truly believe I'm the one who wants to see you the happiest and the only one who can do it. Acting high and mighty would only manifest the fears of my insecurities, that is, losing you to someone else. I don't want that. I know I've got to change, specially for myself and admitting my vices doesn't make me weak. All in all I know it will take time and I want you by me throughout. Admitting this is a way of taking a step forward for myself. I too like you want to be a source of joy rather than sorrow.</p>

<p>My dear Darya, once again I propose to you, with the intention of someday being able to see you bear my surname and myself officially being a part of your family.</p>

<p>I also want to make it clear that no, you're not the cause of detoriation of my mental health. Rather because it worsened and my fears and anxiety rose I began acting that way around you. So if you ever felt guilty for being the cause, I want to assure that it wasn't you. I want to find solutions for myself, give more time to myself but at the same time want to spend some quality time with you as well. Let there be breaks than breakups, honest complaints over untrue "yea that's fine" and a consideration for our emotions as well.</p>

<p>And finally I want to apologize as well, if right from the beginning I'd have admitted I needed help, things wouldn't have come to being this uneasy. Truth is this is my first dealing with psychological issues of this type. I'm thankful that I've had to never face them back in my school life but college in more ways than not is hella depressing, someday would like to tell you in details why it feels this way.</p>

      When you are done reading it and have somewhat collected your thoughts, please do give me a call unless it's absolutely not possible at the moment. Because I think this is something too important to just type around in messages. <br>We need to have an heart to heart on this and a call would give this more justice.
