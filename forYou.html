              You are a really beautiful girl, both inside and outside. Beautiful things are desired by many. You yourself are aware how many people have tried to hit on you and still try and being hit on feels good. Knowing that you are desired never hurts however much you may call them porcelain or glass. Am I wrong?

              Call it my jealousy I wouldn't deny.
              Remember how you once said in 2022 that I just go around sending the same messages to everyone? This time I had been feeling that way.

              Maybe you don't go around saying 'I love you' the same way you do for me. But I have seen with my own eyes, what can I deny? <br>
              On Valentines day, you sent the two pictures to me first. But on VK, you sent the valentines day card to the physics boy, that too with a cheesy message and in reply he did so on your profile.
              Da, I am calling it cheesy because I still vividly remember how things began between us. I didn't even know about this till 1st April 2024 when I just happened to open your gifts section to see my April fools sticker. <br>
              And another thing I saw is, you openly gave him that sticker (your name visible) while the one you gave me on 13th February was private (just I could see the sender's name).

              I had never bothered with things like that because I didn't understand how VK works much. I think it's maybe the wit and humor of Russians to message like that, so wouldn't speak much on it. <br>
              Then comes the part where whatever pic you would send me on Telegram, pretty soon would find it on your wall as well. Pretty much reminded me of what you said back then and how you yourself forgot.

            Whenever it came to me you would be ignoring for long, and when I calculated the time coincided with that, at last I became so annoyed that I had sat for couple of days for hours to just see if you were actually busy or just not being there. Later I confronted.

            Let's leave aside the fact last August when I visted Rishav's home on his birthday you told me to wish him 'congratulations of the day' and on my birthday 'do you remember I love you 365 days a year and just not today?' <br>
            The fact you sent Valentines day stickos to others while a cryptic message to me, blin.

          <div class="slide-text">10.
            I knew none of it, in fact didn't even get to know about this guy till around on March 9th or 13th whereas you had been exchanging such stickos for over 3 months by then, and the fact I mentioned about his display picture. I can clearly tell he's flirtatious. <br>
            When I told in my voice messages that I wanted to hear on this, all you said is that though people can make you laugh at jokes there's none but me who understands you. Then went about how you feel you are a negative character and everyone hates you so and so. Didn't speak on him.

            Sometimes I very much wish I was one of you people to have spoken the same tongue as you so that I could have communicated much more openly with you... but then I remember, what had I been doing for the last 3 years then? Did this ever cause my alienation? Learning Russian would be a bonus but has nothing to do with this alienation.

            This year hasn't been going good for me, beginning with the kitten passing away, then Budbak (I still mourn for him every Sunday), father's falling health, aunt's end stage cancer. Personal grievances related to my birthday, alienating behavior from you, legal troubles. Everything led me slip into more and more depression.

            During that time I more than ever wanted you by me. I acted artificially too, trying to paint everything optimistically, wanting to start conversations on random things. I know that's not how things work, but you never chose to open up on what really interested you and being in the state of mind I was where everything is gradually slipping away I find it hard to be my jolly self. When I asked you to tell and you were like, "you tell, I like to listen" then went around jumping out of telegram to Vk, it really hurt.

              When I told you about everything, you actually took note of and you pay attention to these small details, I have been really really glad. I want to thank you very much for that. It brought me so much joy.

              Truth be told, mb all these things that are hurting me so much (like the stickos, jokes shared with them, etc.), mb I wouldn't even have bothered with. But because I'm in the state I am, I've started thinking too much about everything. Whenever I get a reason to be anxious, I'm turning so. I myself don't enjoy being like this but rn it's something I can't do anything about.

              All I want to say is, however I try to show myself as I'm going to turn a victor once again, I am shattered from within and everyday I wake up and spend the day as if I am in some nightmare. All that was attractive about me is gone, all my little quirks are at rest, suppressed under this feeling of melancholy and nothingness. <br>
              There is no longer maybe anything that I can passionately go around for hours. Forget hours, even minutes seem hard.

              All I want is to have you by me. I am tired of being a psychologist analytically trying to find reasons behind everything pretending I can bear it all and all will be well. All I want to be is yours one and only. I know saying this after all that has happened, isn't sincere.  I want to say, I beg you to be with me. <br>
              I don't want to be a burden to you but all I can be rn is just a burden.
              I promise someday you wouldn't have to see me as a burden but I don't know how soon that day may come.

              I am sorry, please forgive all my sins. Please be with me Dasha. Please. <br>
              I know there is nothing materially nor mentally I may give you, rather you might be the one who has to give. Things maybe even unpleasant dealing with an insecure person.
              I just want to say, I am not like this because I wanted to be. I neither wanted things to end between us nor did I want to be an anxious insecure jealous creep. <br>
              If I were my jolly self I better than anyone know that I would have simply asked you to introduce me to him and would have joked about making black body radiation chambers and putting hydrogen gas inside it with him.

              Someday I hope that I can be back to my good moods, I kind of regret now joking that depression doesn't exist and it has been created by psychiatrists to sell their trade axaxxa.
              Please my love, I want to get back together with you. <br>
              I don't know how it would change anything about this condition, but all I know is this is my little wish. As silly as it may sound I want it. <br>
              I don't know anymore what your tastes nowadays are like, da music ik axaxaxa. I also know you paint and I know nothing of it... I don't know how and in what my passion may come. All for now I know is that I'd place all my prayers and hopes in this webpage design I learnt to create from scratch by myself.
