            This took me a lot of time and effort to make, I had to learn through a lot of new techniques and modes to make it and it failed many times. I wanted to present to you whatever I wanted to say in a beautiful manner in a way that showed 'I care', so I want you to read it full. Go through all the sub pages and even listen to the song I kept there. Everything here means a lot to me.

          <h1>Dear Dasha,</h1>
          <p>
            I am extremely sorry. After that nightmarish experience, I could not help but start blurting out everything.
            I felt so miserable panicking right at the beginning of a new day that I just wanted to disappear, from everywhere. I truly felt pathetic.
          </p>
          <p>
            The truth is many of your past inactions and words have pricked me and often went on ringing in my ears for days. I never spoke of them, bearing them within. For example, some words that still ring every moment in my ears are "long winded" and "I don't live in the internet".
          </p>
          <p>
            Now that we are trying to turn around a new leaf, I can't help but feel pathetic when these traumas keep on surfacing. I am very emotional and such strong traumas leave me numb in fear.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are a lot of things which I haven't been informed about and it feels like you are intentionally hiding them. I can't help but feel this way especially when I stumble across things. It feels as if God wants to show me that there are many things she hides from you out in public domain.
          </p>
          <p>
            I don't know if you consider that as hiding but rn I feel this way.
          </p>
          <p>
            For a long time I had been thinking everything is wrong with me and suffering but now when I discover these, I actually burst out crying. However much I love you, however much I see you as my heart, realising somethings hurt more than anything.
          </p>
          <p>
            However much you may remember me in your thoughts and show gratitude in words, lack of actions sting a lot. By this time you are well aware of how I think and even more about how I feel.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your nightmare is me cutting communications with you and my living nightmare is feeling you don't care enough.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example when I confessed about my mental breakdowns, howsoever much I knew things might never be the same anymore, I felt, at least she could call me and ask, "Are you alright?" I know I said some really creepy things in my confession but I still wanted to hear those words more than anything.
          </p>
          <p>
            I know I live thousands of kilometers away and the only way we communicate is through the internet. But still, you are very much a part of my life.
          </p>
          <p>
            When people tell me harsh words, it stings really bad but all this time I knew I had a better half for whom I mean a lot, much more than those words could ever make me hurt.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am like a fabric which if worn too much becomes dirty and ultimately tears. I already have got holes in some places and feel so dirty. I don't want to be disposed off, however difficult it might be, I want to be cleaned, mended and worn again.
          </p>
          <p>
            You have yourself gone through difficult times, haven't you? You know how difficult it feels, being on the verge of wanting to give up on life itself.
          </p>
          <p>
            Still, am I too selfish for wanting to cling to you?
          </p>
          <p>
            When you have read it all. I want you to call me. There are some words that are best spoken over mouth than letters can ever convey.
